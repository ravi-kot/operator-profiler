# Report

Add your **dashboard screenshot** here for the main README.

1. Take a screenshot of the OperatorProfiler dashboard (e.g. after opening http://127.0.0.1:8080 or your Vercel URL).
2. Save it as **`dashboard.png`** in this folder (`report/dashboard.png`).
3. In the root **README.md**, uncomment the line that shows the image:
   ```markdown
   ![OperatorProfiler Dashboard](report/dashboard.png)
   ```
4. Commit and push so the screenshot appears on GitHub.
